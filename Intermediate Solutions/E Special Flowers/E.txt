Special Flowers
Amy would like to figure out if a flower is special by figuring out if the number of petals is a prime number. A Prime number is a number that’s factors are 1 and itself. An example is the number 7. It’s factors are 1 and 7. The number 1 is NOT a prime number.
Input: int n
Output: boolean (true/false)
Sample:
Input:21					Output: false
Explanation: 21 is not a prime number, as it’s factors are (1,3,7,21)
