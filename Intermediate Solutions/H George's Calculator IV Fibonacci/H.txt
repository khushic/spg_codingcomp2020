Georgeâ€™s Calculator IV: Fibonacci
George wants to add another function to his calculator. This one finds the nth number in the fibonacci sequence. The fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the first two numbers in the list are 1 and every number after that is the sum of the two previous numbers, so the third element would be the sum of the first two: 1+1=2. The fourth element would be the sum of the second and third element: 1+2=3 and so on.
