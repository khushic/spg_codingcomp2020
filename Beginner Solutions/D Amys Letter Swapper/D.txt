Amy’s Letter Swapper
Amy and George are in a competition. George bet Amy that she couldn’t make a word scrambler program too. But since Amy is young, all she needs to do is make a program that takes a string as an input, and 2 indexes. The program will swap the characters at each index. Help Amy out!
Preconditions: a is less than b, a and b are be within the length of str
Input: String str, int a, int b
Output: String
Sample:
Input: “Good Morning”, 3, 9					Output: “Gooi Morndng”
