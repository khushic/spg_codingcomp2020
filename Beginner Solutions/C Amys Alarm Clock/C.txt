Amy’s Alarm Clock
Oh no! George’s sister, Amy, keeps forgetting when to wake up in the morning. She needs to make a program to remind her when to wake up. She will input two booleans, whether it is winter, and whether she is on vacation, and receive a time to wake up at.

If it is winter and vacation, she will wake up at 12:00 pm

If it is winter and not vacation, she will wake up at 7:00 am

If it is not winter and vacation, she will wake up at 11:00 am

If it is not winter and not vacation, she will wake up at 7:00am

Return a string saying what time we must wake up.

Input: boolean winter, boolean vacation
Output: String
Sample:
Input: true, false						Output: “7:00 am”
